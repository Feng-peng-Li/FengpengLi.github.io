## About Me

I am Fengpeng Li (李风朋), currently a PostDoc Research Fellow of [PRADA](https://pradalab1.github.io/), King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), advised by Prof. [Di Wang](https://shao3wangdi.github.io/). Previouly, I obtained my PhD degree in Computer Science at State Key Laboratory of Internet of Things for Smart City (SKL-IoTSC), University of Macau, advised by Prof. [Jiantao Zhou](https://www.fst.um.edu.mo/personal/jtzhou/). Prior to that, I earned my BS degree in Remote Sensing Science and Technology and MS degree in Computer Science and Technology from China University of Geosciences (Wuhan), under the supervision of Prof. [Lizhe Wang](https://grzy.cug.edu.cn/wanglizhe/en/index.htm). I also work closely with Mr. [Kemou Li](https://kemoulee.github.io/), Dr. [Qizhou Wang](https://qizhouwang.github.io/homepage/), Prof. [Haiwei Wu](https://faculty.uestc.edu.cn/wuhaiwei/en/index.htm), and Prof. [Bo Han](https://bhanml.github.io/) in Multimedia Forensics and Trustworthy Machine Learning, and Prof. [Wei Han](https://grzy.cug.edu.cn/hanwei/zh_CN/index.htm), and Prof. [Runyu Fan](https://grzy.cug.edu.cn/fanrunyu/en/index.htm) in Intelligent Spatial Data Analysis and Processing.

I am currently focusing on Trustworth Machine Learning, inlcuding Robust Learning Against Malicious Threats (e.g., Adversarial Attacks, Label Noise, Adversarial Prompt Attacks and ect.), LLM Unlearning, LLM/VLM/VLA Safety Alignment and AI Agent in Spatial Data Analysis and Processing. Please feel free to contact me if you’d like to collaborate or exchange ideas on related topics :-)
